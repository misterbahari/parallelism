Python, with its simplicity and versatility, is a programming language that caters to a wide range of applications.
When it comes to handling multiple tasks concurrently, Python provides two primary approaches: `Asyncio` for
asynchronous programming and `Multithreading` for managing multiple threads.
In this deep dive, we’ll explore these concurrency mechanisms, understand their differences, and discover when to use
each for optimal performance.

Understanding Concurrency:
Concurrency is a concept where multiple tasks or processes make progress independently without waiting for one another.
In the context of programming, it allows a program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing efficiency and
responsiveness.

Multithreading:
Multithreading is a concurrency model where a process is divided into multiple threads of execution. Each thread
represents an independent flow of control within the same process. Python’s `threading` module facilitates the creation
and management of threads.

import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Number: {i}")

def print_letters():
    for letter in 'ABCDE':
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")

# Create two threads
thread_numbers = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread_letters = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start the threads
thread_numbers.start()
thread_letters.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
thread_numbers.join()
thread_letters.join()
In this example, `print_numbers` and `print_letters` can run concurrently in separate threads, enhancing the overall
execution speed.

Asyncio:
Asyncio, introduced in Python 3.4, is an asynchronous programming framework that employs coroutines to achieve
concurrency. Unlike multithreading, asyncio utilizes a single-threaded event loop to manage asynchronous tasks.
